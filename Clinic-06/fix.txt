Encountering this. mlflow is capturing all my experiments OK but can't show results in the UI. which shows "Can't load run details - Float cannot represent non-numeric value: inf"

- performance_df values look good, nothing out of range.
- The artifacts like tear sheets look OK.
- portfolio_stats.csv show monthly_sortino as inf and rf as 0.0
- downloaded mlflow runs.csv has good values for all columns except inf for monthly sortino and porfolio sortino

Just checking to see if anyone has encountered this.


yearly_sortino inf causes MlFlow to bail on showing experiment results. Had to go into mlflow data directory, find metadata for specific run and fix value manually.

[for future reference]
Steps to fix:
open up portfolio_stats.csv in artefacts directory
find which metric has inf value. replace with appropriate value
now go to runs directory and file separate file for same metric and replace inf as in previous step

dont forget, this particular run is compromised in terms of data.
